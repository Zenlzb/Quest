# Quest

Quest Mobile App for Orbital 2021. Our app aims to allow parents/guardians to be able to easily motivate and provide incentives for their children to perform tasks they might otherwise not want to do. Likewise, children will be able to hold their caregivers accountable to their promises and feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in completing the tasks.
